So,this app is to keep the decorum and people can worship easily.

This app automatically becomes silent when it gets the specific wifi name that we have set by default,which is 'keep quiet'
After every 30 seconds the app will scan the list of wifi again,if still the name is present it will remains silent and if not it will again opens the normal mode of mobile.Time is also default set by us.We can change both wifi names and time interval in settings.
